We are a group of Red Hatters from the Red Hat Israeli site.

We are an open-source community - anyone can contribute.

We check each other's work, communicate and collaborate to solve problems.

We strive to be welcoming, respectful, yet make sure that our code follows the latest programming guidelines.
